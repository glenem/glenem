Hello everyone: 

I am Glen Martin: I am currenly a senior economics major at Fresno State. 
I want to become an econometrician who utilizes machine learning for business and economics problems.

I am currently learning about Machine Learning (introductory stuff), and SQL.

A fun fact about me is that I love fishing. Every summer my dad and I try to go tuna fishing out of San Diego.
